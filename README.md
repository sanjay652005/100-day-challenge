💯 100 Days of Full Stack Development Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Full Stack Challenge! 🚀
This is a personal journey to sharpen my web development skills by building real-world projects every single day — from frontend basics to backend mastery.

🧠 What This Challenge Is About

The goal is simple:
👉 Learn, build, and share something new every day using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and later move into React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and more.

Each day, I work on small, focused projects that strengthen my understanding of core concepts and help me grow as a full stack web developer.

🏗️ What I’ll Be Building

Throughout this challenge, I’ll create:

🎨 Interactive Frontend Components (HTML, CSS, JS)

⚙️ Functional Web Apps with Logic and User Interaction

🧩 Backend APIs and Database Connections (later days)

🌐 Full Stack Projects integrating everything learned

📅 Daily Progress
